    "description":"\nYou can put a song in someone's heart. Please donate: \n\nPlease donate: https://www.animalaidunlimited.org/donations/monthly-donation/. \n\nThis precious teenaged puppy screamed in pain when his rescuers tried to lift him. His feet had been run over by a vehicle, and one paw was crushed and degloved. His toes were splayed and swollen to twice their normal size. Standing was too excruciating to bear. Had he been an older dog with more brittle bones, he might have been facing an amputation, but this young boy still had soft bones. \n\n\nWe treated his wound and wrapped his intensely painful feet in thick bandages which we changed every day. The little guy was one of the most careful young patients we've ever had. He seemed determined to cause no fuss. But he was so inward we wondered if he was depressed. Then, when he'd progressed a bit on his healing journey, well, this boy burst out in song. Meet Elvis now!"

    "organization_name":"Animal Aid Unlimited, India";
    "description":"Please make a donation to help rescue street animals: https://www.animalaidunlimited.org/donations/monthly-donation/ \n\nThe blood gradually began to ooze from the deep huge forehead wound caused by a rope squeezing tighter and tighter over months. Ownerless, we cannot fathom what moved someone to bind this poor gentle boy in the first place, only to then turn him loose to find his food on roadside plants and grasses. He grew, but the rope, of course, did not. When we found him, he was starting to fade away. Pain had dulled his appetite and he'd grown weary of fighting it. But within hours we had the maggots out of the wound, flushed away all the dirt and blood, and soothed him with a snug bandage that we would change daily for 7 weeks. We're so eager for you to meet Socrates here. The best remedy for human mistreatment of animals is extra kindness. \n\nRescue date : 16 January 2020"

    "description":"This is Bansi and we must tell you from the beginning--he was rescued, completely healed and he has flourished. The beginning of the video is particularly heart-breaking, and the question that will probably fill your heart and mind as you watch it is simply Why? Why would the owners tie this donkey so cruelly? What deranged mind is behind this? To what purpose? Sometimes the answer Ignorance is not sufficient. We immediately began the 2 month treatment process for Bansi and he healed beautifully. He also happens to be adorable, innocent, agreeable, quiet. He's happy now and police arrested and jailed his cruel owner. \n\nThere are about 600 working donkeys in Udaipur. \n\nWe are working to save as many as we can, with medical treatment, police and legal aid, and donkey education.

When they came closer they saw to their horror that the rod had pierced through her thigh and she had impaled her. She couldn't get free no matter how she struggled. They called Animal Aid to the rescue, and we quickly arranged for workers to come with an electric metal saw. \n\nThe terrified dog had to endure terrifying sounds of the saw against the metal, but we covered comforted her while the rod was cut and we were able to free her. \n\nHer wound was serious but because no bones had broken, we were able to clean, bandage and protect her with antibiotics. After her ordeal, she needed extra love to find the courage she would need to heal. \n\n And after a month of daily wound dressings and many cuddles, meet Shylee now!"
